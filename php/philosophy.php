<h1>Our philosophy</h1>

<p>Jappix is a free software. Free as in free speech AND beer. We believe that Jappix has to be free to access to everyone. We believe that Jappix has to be respectfull of your data. We believe that Jappix has to be independent of the power of companies.</p>
<p>Jappix is yours. Jappix is ours. Jappix belong to everyone. That's why we choose to use the <abbr title="Affero General Public License">AGPL</abbr> license for your software. This license permit you to run, to read, to modify, to adapt the source code of Jappix<sup>1</sup>. You can make Jappix whatever you want! But, in order to preserve Jappix from private code, AGPL says that you must provide access to its (modified or not) source code, even if you run it as a <abbr title="Software as a Service">SaaS</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, Jappix is managed by the french association <a href="http://post-pro.fr">PostPro</a>. This guarantees that Jappix developers will never earn any money of their work. We do not make Jappix to make money. We make Jappix because we believe in a better web. Of course, you can donate to our project. But it will be just used for our servers, to participate to events (like RMLL)<sup>2</sup>...</p>
<p>Don't forget, Jappix is yours. Have an idea? Feel free to implement it then send us a patch<sup>3</sup> and we'll incorporate in the official release!</p>
<p>Want to help but you don't have idea? No problem, you're in the right place! You can go to <a href="http://developer.jappix.org/0.9.1">our roadmap</a> and implement new features, or you can go to <a href="https://github.com/jappix/jappix/issues">our bugtracker</a> to resolve bugs!</p>
<p>We hope that you will enjoy Jappix!</p>

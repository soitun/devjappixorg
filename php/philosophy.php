<h2>Free Software</h2>

<article  class="width" style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.1em;">
<p style="padding-right: 50px;">Jappix is a free software. It means you can use it, share it, access to the code and modify it. We believe that Jappix has to be free to access to everyone. We believe that Jappix has to be respectfull of your data. We believe that Jappix has to be independent of the power of companies. That’s why Jappix is free.</p>
<p style="padding-right: 50px;">Jappix is yours. Jappix is ours. Jappix belong to everyone. That's why we choose to use the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html title="Affero General Public License">AGPL</a> license for your software. This license permit you to run, to read, to modify, to adapt the source code of Jappix. You can make Jappix whatever you want! But, in order to preserve Jappix from private code, AGPL says that you must provide access to its (modified or not) source code, even if you run it as a <abbr title="Software as a Service">SaaS</a>.</p>

<h3>An idea of a better web</h3>
<p>Jappix is an XMPP web client. We think that make a better web is one of the most important thing. Therefore, we try to respect the web standards and try to use as much as possible HTML5 and CSS3</p>
<p>The web is more and more social. One of Jappix’ goals are to foster communication. We don’t want a centralized web, that’s why you can manage your own Jappix node. We don’t want your data to be scattered all over the internet, that’s why we use XMPP, a universal protocol that helps you to be closer!</p>

<h2>Non profit project managment</h2>
<article  class="width" style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.1em;">
<p style="padding-left: 50px;">Moreover, Jappix is managed by <a href="http://post-pro.fr">PostPro</a> french non-profit organization. This guarantees that Jappix developers won’t earn any money of their work. We’ve made Jappix because we believe in a better web. Of course, you can donate to our project. But it will be <a href="http://www.post-pro.fr/soutien-en">just used</a> for our servers, to participate to events (as LSM or other conferences)…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50px;">Don't forget, Jappix is yours. Have an idea? Feel free to implement it then <a href="https://github.com/jappix/jappix">send us a patch</a> and we'll incorporate in the official release!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50px;">Want to help but you don't have idea? No problem, you're in the right place! You can go to <a href="http://developer.jappix.org/0.9.1">our roadmap</a> and implement new features, or you can go to <a href="https://github.com/jappix/jappix/issues">our bugtracker</a> to fix bugs!</p>
<p>We hope you’ll enjoy Jappix!</p>
